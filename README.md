# Stock_Price_Prediction
Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
Project Overview

This project predicts future stock prices using historical stock market data. It leverages Machine Learning algorithms to analyze patterns in stock prices and make predictions.
The main goal is to help users make data-driven decisions when analyzing stock trends.

Features

Predict next day or future stock prices.

Supports multiple ML algorithms:

Linear Regression

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost

Support Vector Regressor (SVR)

Visualize predicted vs actual stock prices.

Can be extended with technical indicators like:

Moving Average (MA)

Relative Strength Index (RSI)

MACD

Dataset

Historical stock data including:

Open, High, Low, Close prices

Trading Volume

Can be downloaded via yfinance or any CSV from sources like Yahoo Finance or Kaggle.

Example of loading data using Python:

import yfinance as yf
data = yf.download('TSLA', start='2018-01-01', end='2025-01-01')

Machine Learning Models Used

Linear Regression – simple model assuming linear relationship.

Random Forest Regressor – captures non-linear patterns.

XGBoost Regressor – gradient boosting for better accuracy.

SVR (Support Vector Regressor) – captures non-linear trends with kernels.

Project Workflow

Data Collection – Download historical stock data.

Data Preprocessing – Handle missing values, scale data, create features.

Feature Engineering – Add lag values, moving averages, and indicators.

Model Training – Train ML models on historical data.

Prediction & Evaluation – Predict stock prices and evaluate using RMSE.

Visualization – Plot predicted vs actual prices for analysis.

Requirements

Python >= 3.8

Libraries:

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, xgboost, yfinance

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn xgboost yfinance

Usage

Clone this repository:

git clone <your-repo-link>
cd stock-price-prediction





Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script to train and test models.

Visualize predicted vs actual prices using matplotlib.

Future Improvements

Add LSTM or GRU for better sequential prediction.

Include sentiment analysis from news or social media.

Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask.

Predict price direction (up/down) instead of exact value.
